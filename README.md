# pdf2ppt

In my university, slides typically come in PDF format which is not useful for students because we might want to doodle or type notes directly into the slide itself. This is why this Telegram chatbot was born.

# Setup
1. Run `npm install` to install all the `node_modules`
2. Run `npm run init` which will create a `temp` folder for storing pdf and pptx for conversion.
3. Run `node app.js` to run the application.
